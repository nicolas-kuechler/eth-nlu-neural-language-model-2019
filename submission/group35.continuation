what if they 're not home and they 're going to be a good thing ? '' <eos>
multiple times , he thought . <eos>
he assured me it was a good thing , but i did n't want to be alone . <eos>

the man in the back seat wailed as the <unk> <unk> . <eos>
he sprang forward , flung the door wide open , and then jumped . <eos>
how do i know you wont one day hit me ? <eos>
like how he could drive such a wedge between them . <eos>
if only he could channel that towards his bedroom , and the <unk> of the <unk> . <eos>
no matter what my dad said , there had to be a way to get out of this . <eos>
`` she 's a <unk> , '' he said . <eos>

she sighed but did n't open her eyes . <eos>
the band slowed to a stop . <eos>
